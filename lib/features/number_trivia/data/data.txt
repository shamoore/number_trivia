repository is brains - chooses when to get data, local or remote
data sources output models, repositories output entities

models extend entities, add functionality. cast into entity so repo can output the entity without the extra.

local storage is caching -- db, sharedPrefs, etc.

remote used if internet otherwise local
always cache data
